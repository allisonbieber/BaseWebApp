                 <p> I began my post-undergraduate career in the Environmental Science industry, but I have 
                     always had a passion for computers and technology and in 2018 decided to pursue a master's 
                     degree in computer science. I am currently in the computer science master's program at 
                     Northeastern University in San Jose, CA. </p>
                 <p> My experience in software development is primarily as a full-stack developer. 
                     I recently completed a 6 month co-op where I was able to work on and complete a 
                     full-stack project using ReactJS, JavaScript, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. In school 
                     my concentration of study is database management. In my free time I enjoy learning about the 
                     latest technologies in cybersecurity and AI.</p>
